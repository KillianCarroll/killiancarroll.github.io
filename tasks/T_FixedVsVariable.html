    <p>A fixed rate mortgage means you will accumulate interest due on your loan at a fixed rate for a number of years, usually anywhere between 3 and 7 years. 
        A variable rate means your interest rate is subject to change at the discretion of the bank, though they are required to notify you before changing the rate.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some of the key considerations when making your decision:</p>
    <li>Fixed rate mortgages provide more stability and peace of mind. You won't need to consider interest rates until your fixed term expires.</li>
    <li>Typically on fixed rate mortgages, you will not be able to pay back lump sums of your loan without incurring a fee. 
        With variable rate loans, you are free to repay lump sums or overpay on a monthly basis at your leisure to reduce monthly payments or your mortgage length. 
    </li>
    <li>Fixed rate loans allow you to lock in a lower interest rate in a market where interest rates are likely to rise, where variable rate loans allow 
        you to take advantage of lower interest when interest rates are falling.
    </li>
